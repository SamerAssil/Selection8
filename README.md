# Selection8
TSelection8 is an enhanced FireMonkey (FMX) component that improves upon the native TSelection. While the standard component only offers 4 corner handles, TSelection8 adds 4 additional mid-point handles (Top, Bottom, Left, and Right) for a total of 8 control points.

Works in Delphi 13. 
I didn't test it in previous Delphi versions.
